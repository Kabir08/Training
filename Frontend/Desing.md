# FastAPI Design & Training Guide

**Objective:** Familiarity with FastAPI

## FastAPI for a Five-Year-Old (Zoo Analogy)

Imagine the zoo has a chef (FastAPI) who prepares special meals (API responses) for every animal and visitor. You just tell the chef what you want, and the chef quickly makes it, following a recipe (endpoint). The chef is super fast and can handle many orders at once!

- Chef = FastAPI app
- Recipe = API endpoint
- Order = HTTP request
- Meal = HTTP response

```

## Quick Start

1. **Install FastAPI & Uvicorn**
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn
   ```
2. **Create `main.py`**
   ```python
   from fastapi import FastAPI
   app = FastAPI()

   @app.get("/")
   def read_root():
       return {"Hello": "World"}
   ```
3. **Run the server**
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
4. **Open docs**: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

## Best Practices
- Use Pydantic models for data validation (like checking ingredients before cooking)
- Use async endpoints for speed
- Handle errors gracefully (return clear error messages)
- Document your endpoints (OpenAPI docs)
- Keep business logic separate from endpoint definitions

---

## Deep Dive: Advanced FastAPI
- **Dependency Injection:** Like the chef getting ingredients/tools from helpers
- **Background Tasks:** Chef can start a meal and keep cooking while something else finishes
- **Middleware:** Special kitchen rules applied to every order
- **Authentication:** Only certain visitors can order special meals
- **Deployment:** Use Uvicorn/Gunicorn for production, add HTTPS, use Docker
