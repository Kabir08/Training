# GitHub & GitHub Actions Design & Training Guide

**Objective:** Familiarity with GitHub and CI/CD

## GitHub for a Five-Year-Old (Zoo Analogy)

Imagine the zoo has a big library (GitHub) where every animal's story (code) is kept. There are robots (GitHub Actions) that help organize, clean, and even build new animal homes whenever a new story is added!

- Library = GitHub repo
- Story = Code/project
- Robots = GitHub Actions
- New book = Pull request/commit

```

## Quick Start
- **Clone a repo:**
  ```bash
  git clone <repo-url>
  ```
- **Make changes and commit:**
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "message"
  git push
  ```
- **Open a pull request**
- **Review and merge**

---

## Best Practices
- Use branches for features/bugfixes
- Write clear commit messages
- Use pull requests for all changes
- Protect main branches
- Use Actions for CI/CD
- Store secrets securely

---

## Deep Dive: Advanced GitHub & Actions
- **Reusable workflows:** Robots that help in many libraries
- **Matrix builds:** Robots test many animal homes at once
- **Caching:** Robots remember old builds to go faster
- **Security:** Control who can add/change stories
- **Integrations:** Connect to other zoos (Slack, Jira, etc.)
